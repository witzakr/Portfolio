                    Persona is a fictional character that represents your target users. 
                    Personas are a UX tool, that allows you to better understand your target audience and make design decisions accordingly. 
                    So it pretty much means that you collect data about your target audience, compile it, and create personas around it. <br>
                    In our case, since we used this method in our group project to collect data, 
                    we used a survey (the topic of the survey will be expanded in its own tab), 
                    and then we used a premade template, 
                    found on the internet, to put the data together. Out of it, 
                    we created two personas, each with the name, industry, 
                    biography, discovery method, and preferences, and with the answers from the survey, 
                    we concluded, that certain preferences and discovery methods among our target group would repeat and that gave us information on how to progress with our project. 
                    An example of certain information repeating would be that our target group prefers minimalistic design, 
                    and value search filters and that they use laptops as their primary device. 
                    Also, the discovery method would repeat, since from the data we got, our target group finds portfolio websites mostly through social media. <br>
                    Overall I consider this method very useful in the whole research process. 
                    Some could argue that it pretty much does the same stuff as putting data into diagrams, 
                    but in my opinion, it helps visualize your target group and current trends among it, 
                    and most importantly it keeps the user in the center of the whole process. 
                    At first, glance, creating personas seems like something tedious, 
                    but after a while, the process of doing it is actually pretty enjoyable (can't say that about every research method). 
                    Lastly, from the perspective of someone who likes to organize and look at nicely organized data, 
                    I consider this method very useful and I believe that using it will almost always pave the way to user-friendly UI and UX. <br>
