                    Creating and sending a survey was part of the research for our project. 
                    The survey is usually a short questionnaire sent out to the target group to gather information about current trends and preferences among it. 
                    It's very important to distinguish the difference between interviews, 
                    cause a survey is normally written and sent out to many different people, 
                    but an interview is normally a one-on-one verbal conversation. <br>
                    The topic of a survey our group conducted was "Artist Portfolio Website/User Experience". 
                    It was divided into two parts, "User demographic" and "User Experience and Preferences". 
                    The first part was responsible for collecting data about our demographics, 
                    in which there were some crucial data like age or role background. 
                    The second one was responsible for collecting data about user experience and preferences, 
                    in which people answering the interview would answer questions on "Website features", "Device preference" and "Design preference". 
                    At the conclusion of the survey, we provided a feedback form so the user could choose to share additional thoughts about the website or the survey. 
                    Of course, it was completely optional for them to fill it. Lastly, it's also important to mention our target group. 
                    We mainly focused on the people that were interested in art, since our project is a portfolio website, 
                    that will be displaying art made by our client. We send it to media students around our university and the Van Abbemusem. <br>
                    In summary, I find this research method extremely important for the development process. Understanding our target group, 
                    and utilizing the collected data to create personas and visual diagrams, has allowed us to identify current trends among our target group. 
                    This, in turn, has significantly contributed to enhancing the quality of our project. My role in the survey involved crafting some of the questions, 
                    where the wording was crucial to ensure clarity for all participants, both in understanding the questions and providing accurate answers. <br>
