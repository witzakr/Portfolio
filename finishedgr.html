                    Finally, after completing all the different stages, presenting our ideas, and doing the coding, we can proudly say that our project is finished, 
                    and it was a success. On January 18th, we had a meeting with our client, and they were pleased with the website we created. <br>

                    The coding part was tough and took a long time, but we made it through. Our group divided the tasks, and I was in charge of creating a contact page and helping with the gallery. 
                    Making the contact form wasn't too difficult, but making it work properly required me to learn more. I tried using PHP, but we couldn't use it without an SMTP server.
                    After discussing it as a group, we found a solution. Now, after filling out the contact form, users get forwarded to their email. <br>

                    We also had some issues with formatting images, but we figured it out in the end. It was a challenging 17 weeks with ups and downs, but it all turned out great. 
                    I learned a lot about Front-End development, research, and communication during this time, and I'm hopeful for the next semester. <br>

                    As a group, we also created documentation about our project, including details, the work we did, descriptions of each phase, conclusions, the process, and contributions.
