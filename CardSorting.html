                    Card sorting is a UX research method used to discover how people understand and categorize information. 
                    It is a quite helpful research method that is crucial in the whole process of developing functional and logical navigation around the website. 
                    The method is divided into two segments, categories and subcategories. 
                    In this assignment, categories are represented by purple cards and subcategories by blue ones. 
                    The next step is assigning names to those cards and putting the cards that represent categories in a logical order. 
                    After that is done, the task is given to the user, to assign subcategories to appropriate categories, and if its outcome is correct, 
                    then the development team can move into later stages of development, if not, then the team needs to reorganize their plan for navigation of the website. <br>
                    Me and my group members decided to apply card sorting to the research of our project
                    since clear navigation is a crucial part of every well-functioning website and this method is a solid way to see if its planned-out navigation is logical 
                    and solid enough to continue into the latter stages of the project. We divided the categories into "Home", "Art", "Research" and "About me" and to subcategories, 
                    we assigned parts that our client wanted to be included in the website. After that, we found a user who was given the task of assigning subcategories to appropriate 
                    categories and the outcome of it was a success. Lastly, I can also mention that the client had pre-established requirements 
                    for the website navigation, so it was really important to properly research if the layout was logical and easy to navigate around. <br> 
                    Overall, I consider this method a very useful and inseparable part of the development process and if I don't find anything better, I will definitely use it in the next projects.
