                    The interview was a part of our project research in order to get professional expertise on the topic of how to create a well-functioning and solid portfolio website. <br>
                    First, our team created a set of interview questions that focused on essential aspects of our project. 
                    These questions covered topics such as gathering opinions about our client's current website, improving website navigation, 
                    and selecting suitable colors for the website's layout. After that, our group sent questions to different agencies 
                    and got the chance to interview a Resolut brand designer. They shared helpful insights about their experience in web design and gave tips on the process, 
                    like creating a design concept and values before starting the actual design. They also gave advice on finding inspiration in design. 
                    This information was really useful for our group project, and we can confidently say that this research method worked well for us. <br>
                    In my opinion, this approach is quite beneficial, especially for individuals starting their journey as web developers. 
                    Learning from those with more experience is a crucial aspect of evolving into a professional in this field. 
                    However, for those already well-versed in the field, this method may be redundant and unnecessary for project implementation.
