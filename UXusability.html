                    For my assignment on User-Centered Design (UCD), I picked two products to study their user experience: the iPhone as an example of good design and a microwave with a complicated control panel representing a not-so-great experience.
                    I really enjoyed doing this assignment because it changed the way I look at products, and I think it will be helpful in the future. The iPhone, known for its smooth user experience, became my positive example. On the flip side, I chose a microwave that made things complicated with its confusing control panel.
                    Through research and personal experiences, I made a list of what's good about the iPhone and what's bad about the microwave. The iPhone stood out for its easy-to-use design, accessibility, and overall user satisfaction. On the other hand, the microwave's tricky control panel highlighted issues like confusion, inefficiency, and frustration.
                    This assignment not only helped me understand how to evaluate products but also gave me a new perspective on why user-friendly design is so important. I believe this knowledge will come in handy in the future as I encounter different products and designs.
