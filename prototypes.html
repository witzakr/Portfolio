                    Our group worked on two prototypes for our project: one for mobile devices and another for laptops.
                    The mobile prototype was designed to meet our client's request for a responsive website on mobile devices, 
                    while the laptop prototype served as the base for stationary devices. Despite having the same functions, 
                    the mobile version was a scaled-down version of the laptop prototype. <br>
                    The main differences between the two prototypes include the display for artwork and the navigation layout. 
                    In the mobile version, the navigation is placed in a dropdown menu instead of a bar on top of the website, 
                    and the buttons are larger to enhance usability on smaller screens.<br>
                    Creating a prototype can take time, but I find it enjoyable. 
                    It's a culmination of all the phases we've gone through and the lessons we've learned. 
                    One important thing to keep in mind is not to overdo it. Since it's just a prototype, there's no need to include excessive details. 
                    A basic layout for the website and some functional elements, like navigation, suffice. I've learned this the hard way in the past, 
                    as I used to include too many details or plan prototypes incorrectly. This made the development process for other projects more challenging. 
                    However, the experience gained from those situations has been valuable.
