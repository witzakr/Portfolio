                    Our assignment tasked us with creating a short video on a topic of our choice for a group project. 
                    After some deliberation, we settled on the idea of doing a food review, specifically focusing on Döner kebab. 
                    We decided to structure our video in the style often seen in popular YouTube food reviews. <br>

                    To prepare for the recording, we initiated the process 
                    by brainstorming and creating a storyboard. Our plan was to visit three restaurants located near our university. 
                    Before capturing any footage, we sought permission from each restaurant to film on their premises. Once we received approval, 
                    we took shots of the exterior of each restaurant. <br>

                    The next step involved purchasing our Döner kebab meals and heading outside to taste-test them. 
                    We recorded our experiences trying the different meals and later added the final verdict, along with additional shots discussing the history of Döner. 
                    The editing process was handled by one of our group members, who demonstrated high-level skills in creating an engaging video. <br>

                    This assignment marked my first experience with such a project. Planning the entire process proved to be a 
                    fascinating endeavor, with the most enjoyable aspect being the on-screen participation during the food review.
