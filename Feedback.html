                    On Monday I showed two assignments to the teacher, an empathy map and an observation challenge.
                    Those two assignments received a positive note, especially the observation challenge,
                    cause it included a lot of details and was very well made.
                    Overall I am satisfied with my progress for now and I am motivated to continue working on future assignments.

                    On Tuesday I showed my protfolio to my Project teacher. The feedback I received was to firstly improve the background, since it looked to minimalistic, 
                    second was to add the description to the assignments, and lastly overall improve the quality of the whole website. I will apply those fixes straight away

                    Today I showed my portfolio to my UCD teacher. 
                    The note I had was to improve the navigation around the website and fix some minor spelling errors. 
                    I will apply those fixes straight away.

                    Today I showed my protfolio to my Project teacher. The changes I've implemented were satisfactory and overall I recived a positive feedback. 
                    The only problems were the centered text and undetailed assignments description. 
                    I am happy with the progress I made and I will apply those fixes straight away
