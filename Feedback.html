                    On Tuesday I showed my protfolio to my Project teacher. The feedback I received was to firstly improve the background, since it looked to minimalistic, 
                    second was to add the description to the assignments, and lastly overall improve the quality of the whole website. I will apply those fixes straight away

                    Today I showed my portfolio to my UCD teacher. 
                    The note I had was to improve the navigation around the website and fix some minor spelling errors. 
                    I will apply those fixes straight away.

                    Today I showed my protfolio to my Project teacher. The changes I've implemented were satisfactory and overall I recived a positive feedback. 
                    The only problems were the centered text and undetailed assignments description. 
                    I am happy with the progress I made and I will apply those fixes straight away

                    Today I showed my portfolio and relevant assigments to my FED teacher. Portfolio required some minor improvments, 
                    but as of the assigments the feedback I recived was far from satisfactory. 
                    What I need to fix in my assigments is the better use of semantic elements, 
                    improve responsiblity and overall better code structure. I will get to work straight away

                    Today, I shared my portfolio and snake game assignment with my Front-End Development (FED) teacher. The feedback I received focused on enhancing the navigation of the website. Additionally, the feedback for the snake game assignment was not entirely satisfying because I utilized functions that were not covered in our classes. This could have been acceptable if I had included the relevant research. I plan to address these areas of improvement by refining the navigation of the website and incorporating the necessary research for the snake game assignment.

                    Today, I talked to my teacher about my portfolio, and I got feedback that I need to make some improvements. For the research section, my teacher suggested creating a separate website just for research assignments and providing detailed descriptions of each. In the communication section, I was advised to include emails exchanged with clients. As for the professional identity part, I need to expand the "About Me" page by adding more information about myself. This feedback made me realize there are areas I can improve, and it has motivated me to work on these aspects.

                    Today, I showed my project to the teacher. It included a prototype and a portfolio. The prototype demonstrated a basic shoe store website with simple interactions. In the portfolio, I highlighted the changes I made based on the feedback I received earlier. The overall response to the assignments was positive, and it's motivating me to stay engaged and continue working on my assignments.

                    Today I showed a portion of research text from my portfolio to get feedback and figure out where I can improve. The overall response was good, but I was advised to include more of my personal opinions in the text because it seemed a bit too plain without them.
