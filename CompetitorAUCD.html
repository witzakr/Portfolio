                    Competitor analysis, also referred to as competitive analysis, 
                    is the process of identifying competitors in your industry and 
                    researching their project ideas and functions to see if you can 
                    incorporate some of them into your own, to improve its overall quality. <br>
                    In our case, since this was a group effort, we compared our client's original website with https://www.georgeirvinefineart.co.uk, 
                    since it was a portfolio website that had functions we were planning to use in our project. 
                    After we found a website, we decided to compare a landing page, navigation, an art showcase, 
                    and a footer, since those were things that our client told us to improve. 
                    For each comparison, we wrote a detailed description of how the original 
                    layout and functions compared to the "competition" website. 
                    After that, we concluded, 
                    that we could incorporate some of that layout and functions from the website 
                    to improve our client's portfolio and create a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience. 
                    So in summary, using this method for our project was a success, since we managed to improve our project by comparing it to an already-established website. <br>
                    In website development, I don't really see this method as crucial. Sure, you can use it to learn what works in the industry and include some of those ideas in your project. 
                    However, I believe it might take away from the uniqueness of your project. 
                    It's better, in my opinion, to come up with your own ideas, test them with different methods, and create your own path in the industry.
                    This is what adds quality and freshness to your project. Of course, this depends on your client's needs and how much creative freedom you have in your project. 
                    So lastly I consider this method useful in some scenarios, but in an approach I have, I consider it redundant.
