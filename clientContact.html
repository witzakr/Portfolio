                    Communication with your client is crucial, that is why throughout our whole project we kept it a priority. 
                    It was very important to understand the requirements and the expectations that they had for the project.
                    We mainly talked through emails since that's what the client preferred. <br>
                    The questions we sent out were crucial for the project's development process. 
                    They included important requirements that have to appear in the finished project, 
                    additional requirements, what they want to achieve with their portfolio, social media preferences, 
                    key features, and if they had any inspiration we could model our project after. 
                    Also from time to time, if we had any doubts or we would miss any content, we would reach out to them and resolve those problems quickly. <br>
                    Overall, the communication with the client was very efficient on their part, 
                    they always answered within one day and their answers were always detailed. 
                    The only situation where there was a problem, is that we didn't know our client had a habit of deleting emails after a while, 
                    so the first time we wanted to retrieve their answers, in order to display them in the presentation, we realized they were missing, 
                    so we had to contact our client to retrieve the missing ones. But aside from that, I can confidently say it was a pleasure working with them.
