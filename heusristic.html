                    A heuristic evaluation is a usability inspection method for computer software or websites, 
                    that helps to identify usability problems in the user interface design. 
                    It specifically involves evaluators examining the interface and judging its compliance with recognized usability principles. 
                    This was an assignment prepared for UCD, and I made it with me and my mate Alexander. <br>
                    So, we decided to write a heuristic evaluation of the Adobe Photoshop program, 
                    because this is a program deeply related to the Media course, and in my opinion, at least, it's not made very well.
                     We divided the document into 11 categories, ranging from Visibility of system status, Consistency and Standards, 
                     User Control and Freedom to Error prevention, Flexibility and Efficiency of Use, etc.. 
                     To each of those categories we assigned positive and negative traits, and after that, for some, we linked images to show the interface. <br>
                    Overall this assignment was pretty interesting to make, in the beginning, 
                    I thought it would be something time-consuming and tedious to make, mostly 
                    because the name of this assignment sounded serious, but the work went smoothly and I can confidently say that this assignment was a success.
