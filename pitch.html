                    Our group prepared a short pitch about our group project. 
                    It shows an overview of our project, which includes our specialization, our approach, and the benefits of working with us. <br>
                    Our aim in creating this pitch was to present our project to the client and persuade them to collaborate with us. 
                    The process of putting it together was quite interesting, especially since it was my first time working on a task like this. 
                    e started by gathering in a quiet room at our school and carefully planning out the entire video. 
                    Next, we wrote down the script lines, making sure to include pauses where we wanted to cut the video. 
                    After that, we went ahead and recorded the video. Once the video was done, one of our group members took the time to make sure it looked polished. 
                    They added some music and special effects to enhance the overall presentation. <br>
                    I had a great time working on this assignment, and my favorite part was definitely the planning and writing of the script. 
                    It was my first attempt at something like this, and I'm satisfied with the final result. The only thing I'm a bit critical about is the sound quality.
                    However, that's mainly due to the equipment we used; we put effort into making it the best it could be on our end.
